				A dental implant is a threaded 'root' or 'rod', usually made of
				surgically pure titanium which is inserted into the jaw to
				replace a missing tooth. Once integrated into the jawbone,
				dental implants can help provide support for individual crowns,
				bridges or for the stabilisation of loose dentures.

				A dental implant can support one or more false teeth whilst
				several implants can be used to support an entire mouth of
				missing teeth.

				Most people are suitable patients for dental implants provided
				they are in good health and have adequate bone. Your dentist may
				require an X-ray to determine whether your bone levels are
				suitable for a dental implant. Even in levels where there are
				inadequate bone levels, grafting procedures using bone or bone
				substitutes can be utilised to provide suitable support for
				dental implants.

				As a treatment option, dental implants are long lasting, durable
				and a good option for replacing missing teeth. Although they
				have been proven to be clinically successful and have been in
				use for over 40 years, the demand for cosmetic dentistry has
				made them increasingly popular in recent years.
