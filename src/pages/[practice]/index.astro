				If you would like straighter teeth, or a brighter, whiter smile,
				or even if you would prefer to have natural teeth coloured
				fillings instead of the traditional grey or black fillings,
				please call us on 0115 970 0007 and speak to one of our friendly
				reception team and ask for a cosmetic care consulation - this is
				currently available for a limited period only at a cost of
				Â£30.00 that is payable in advance to see a dentist to discuss
				your needs.
