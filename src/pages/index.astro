					<Text type="body" weight="bold">New NHS Patients</Text>

					If you are a patient seeking to make an appointment as an
					NHS patient at any of our 20 practices, please call the
					telephone number of the practice that you wish to be seen
					at, and an appointment will be arranged if possible. It is
					important to note that due to high demand, an appointment
					may only be available after a considerable time on a waiting
					list. Alternatively, some patients may take the option of
					being seen initially on a Private basis, with the intention
					of becoming an NHS patient at a later date, when the waiting
					list is shorter and more easy to manage.

					Please simply call your practice on the practice telephone
					number and an appointment will be arranged for you in the
					normal way, and this appointment availability will just
					depend on our clinical capacity for you to be seen. Usually
					the time to make an appointment varies from a few days to a
					few weeks for our regular patients.

						Our regular attending NHS patients (in pain)
					</Text>
					If you are a patient in pain or discomfort, and you are a regular
					attender at your dental practice, then normally an NHS appointment
					can be arranged for you, on the understanding that this is an
					emergency appointment, where you will be treated on a "sit and
					wait basis". When a patient is seen on this basis, this can mean
					that there is a possibility of an increased waiting time from
					arrival at the practice to being seen by a dentist. Naturally,
					our teams will do their best for you to be seen as quickly as
					possible, and this is often within 30 minutes, however this can
					be up to 3 hours at busier times, so it is important for you
					to be able to manage your expectations when attending on a sit
					and wait basis.
					<br />
					<br />

					<Text type="body" weight="bold">New Private Patients</Text>
					If you are a new patient, and wish to be seen privately, several
					dental surgeons are able to offer appointments sooner, and these
					may even be available at short notice and even on the same day.
					This availability cannot be gauranteed, however, it is a possibility
					that this can be arranged swiftly. The fee for being seen by
					a dental surgeon on a private basis in an emergency is normally
					Â£50, this is payable at the time of booking the appointment,
					and this fee includes the cost of seeing the dentist and all
					necessary X-rays and does not include the cost of any actual
					treatment need identified.
